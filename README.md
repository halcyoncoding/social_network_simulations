Network simulations for business decisions in an early-stage social app ecosystem

The following is a simulation of network effects on app adoption across Android/IOS platforms to inform the cost/benefit analysis of building a social app taking advantage of IOS features vs a more generic social app that can run on Android and IOS operating systems.

The results show that at reasonable network sizes and time scales, the difference in adoption ratio is not directly proportional to the size of the total network addressed. By breaking networks apart along platform lines, you would not reach the required atomic network size to maintain a positive Allee effect. See the work of Dr. Warder Clyde Allee referenced in relation to social networks by Andrew Chen; essentially big enough networks grow on a logistic curve and become self-sustaining, while networks that don't reach their minimum viable size (atomic network size) naturally fall apart.
